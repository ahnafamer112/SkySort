# SkySort 🌌  
**Machine learning classifier for stars, quasars, and galaxies using Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data.**

## 📖 Overview
SkySort is an astronomy data science project that applies machine learning to classify celestial objects — specifically **stars**, **quasars**, and **galaxies** — based on photometric data from the **Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)**.  

The goal is to demonstrate how modern data analysis and ML techniques can be applied in astrophysics for automated classification, aiding large-scale astronomical surveys.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data acquisition** from SDSS public datasets.  
- **Data preprocessing** and feature engineering.  
- Multiple ML models tested: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.  
- Performance evaluation with accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices.  
- Interactive Jupyter Notebook visualizations.
